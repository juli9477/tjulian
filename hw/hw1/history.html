      <h3>Fluxus Movement</h3>
      <p> Interactive Design was greatly shaped by the Fluxus movement, which centers around a self sufficient aesthetic, anti-commercialism and anti-art sensibility. The Fluxus movement is not a modern-art movement or style, instead it is seen as an international
        organization which includes artists from around the world. There are twelve essential ideas that make up Fluxus, these include: Globalism, Unity of Art and Life, Intermedia, Experimentalism, Chance, Playfulness, Simplicity, Implicativeness, Exemplativism,
        Specificity, Presence in time and Musicality.

        essential to each other.</p>
